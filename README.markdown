##Introduction##
GMavenPlus is a rewrite of [GMaven](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GMAVEN/Home).  It allows you to integrate Groovy into your [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) projects.<br>
The project is currently in the pre-release stage, but the first release should be soon (waiting on our Codehaus new project request to give us a repo to deploy to).<br>
You should find everything you need to know about its use in the [Maven site](http://groovy.github.com/GMavenPlus/index.html).  For more information, check out the [wiki](http://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/wiki).
