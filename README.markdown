##Introduction##
Welcome to the home of GMavenPlus, a rewrite of [GMaven](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GMAVEN/Home) to allow you to integrate Groovy into your [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) projects.
Do note that this project is currently in the pre-beta stage, but you can expect a more rigorous version soon.
You should find everything you need to know about its use in the [Maven site](http://keeganwitt.github.com/GMavenPlus/index.html).
For more information, check out the [wiki](http://github.com/keeganwitt/GMavenPlus/wiki).

I had delayed further work on this to help with GMaven, but since GMaven cannot scale well with invokedynamic change, and I'm [not a huge fan](https://github.com/keeganwitt/GMavenPlus/wiki/About#why-not-just-use-the-groovy-eclipse-compiler-plugin-for-maven) of the Groovy-Eclipse Plugin for Maven approach, I feel I have no choice but to resume work on this project.  I'm sorry if this causes more confusion/fragmentation in the community.
