##Introduction##
Welcome to the home of GMavenPlus, a rewrite of [GMaven](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GMAVEN/Home) to allow you to integrate Groovy into your [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) projects.
Do note that this project is currently in the pre-beta stage, but you can expect a more rigorous version soon.
You should find everything you need to know about its use in the [Maven site](http://keeganwitt.github.com/GMavenPlus/index.html).
For more information, check out the [wiki](http://github.com/keeganwitt/GMavenPlus/wiki).

<b>Important Notice</b>: I am delaying further work on this to help with GMaven.
