#GMavenPlus Plugin#

##Introduction##
GMavenPlus is a rewrite of [GMaven](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GMAVEN/Home), a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) plugin that allows you to integrate Groovy into your Maven projects.<br>
You should find everything you need to know about its use in the [Maven site](http://groovy.github.com/GMavenPlus/index.html).  For more information, check out the [wiki](http://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/wiki).

##Status##
The project is currently in beta, but we plan to do a GA release soon (depending on the feedback we get).
