##Introduction##
Welcome to the home of GMavenPlus, a rewrite of [GMaven](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GMAVEN/Home) to allow you to integrate Groovy into your [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) projects.
Do note that this project is currently in the pre-beta stage, but you can expect a more rigorous version soon.
You should find everything you need to know about its use in the [Maven site](http://keeganwitt.github.com/GMavenPlus/index.html).
For more information, check out the [wiki](http://github.com/keeganwitt/GMavenPlus/wiki).

<b>Important Noticee</b>: I am delaying further work on this to help on the 1.4 release of GMaven.  After this is done, we will begin work on [GMaven 2.0](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GMAVEN/GMaven+2.0+Release) (possibly incorporating stuff from GMavenPlus as well as possibly including stuff from the [Groovy-Eclipse Compiler Plugin for Maven](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy-Eclipse+compiler+plugin+for+Maven)).  I'll be keeping the [GMaven docs](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GMAVEN/Home) updated with our progress.  Stay tuned.
